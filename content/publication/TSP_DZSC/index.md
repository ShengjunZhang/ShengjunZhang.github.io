abstract: This paper investigates the stochastic distributed nonconvex optimiztion problem of minimizing a global cost function formed by the summation of $n$ local cost functions. We solve such a problem with involving zeroth-order (ZO) information exchange. In this paper, two distributed ZO algorithms are proposed. Agents sample their own local stochastic ZO oracle at two different points with an adaptive smoothing parameter.
