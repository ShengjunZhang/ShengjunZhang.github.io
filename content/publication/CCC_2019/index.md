abstract: We propose a distributed event-triggered control law to solve the consensus problem for multi-agent systems with nonlinear output. Under the condition that the underlying digraph is strongly connected, we establish sufficient conditions on the nonlinear output function and initial states to guarantee that the event-triggered controller realizes consensus. Then the results are extended to the case where the underlying directed graph contains a directed spanning tree. These theoretical results are illustrated by numerical simulations.
