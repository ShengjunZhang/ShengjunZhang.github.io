summary:
abstract: This paper investigates the problem of sparse principal component analysis (SPCA), which is an extension of principal component analysis (PCA) for a sparser subspace of the original data. We propose a fully decentralized algorithm based on primal-dual technique to solve SPCA in a distributed manner. The proposed algorithm has the ability to handle massively large datasets stored in multiple machines. The proposed method is shown to converge to stationary solutions of SPCA. Numerical experiments are provided to demonstrate the efficacy of our distributed primal-dual approach.

Slides can be added in a few ways:

- **Create** slides using Wowchemy's [*Slides*](https://wowchemy.com/docs/managing-content/#create-slides) feature and link using `slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Upload** an existing slide deck to `static/` and link using `url_slides` parameter in the front matter of the talk file
- **Embed** your slides (e.g. Google Slides) or presentation video on this page using [shortcodes](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/).

Further event details, including [page elements](https://wowchemy.com/docs/writing-markdown-latex/) such as image galleries, can be added to the body of this page. -->
